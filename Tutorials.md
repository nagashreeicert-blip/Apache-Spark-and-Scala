# 📘 Apache Spark & Scala – Step-by-Step Tutorials

Beginner-Friendly, Practical Learning Guide

These tutorials help you learn Apache Spark and Scala from scratch to practical, project-ready skills. Perfect for beginners, students, and professionals entering the Big Data and distributed computing space.

# 🟡 1. Introduction to Apache Spark & Scala

✔️ What You Will Learn

What is Apache Spark and why it’s used

Overview of Scala programming language

Key goals: Fast, distributed data processing, big data analytics

Difference between Spark Core, Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, MLlib

Real-world examples: Fraud detection, recommendation engines, log analysis

⭐ Key Takeaways

Spark provides scalable, distributed computation for big data.

Scala is the primary language for Spark programming, combining object-oriented and functional paradigms.

# 🟡 2. Scala Basics

✔️ Topics Covered

Variables, Data Types, and Operators

Functions, Methods, and Loops

Collections: List, Map, Set, Array

Functional programming basics: map, filter, reduce
⭐ Simple Example
Transforming a list of numbers to their squares:

val nums = List(1,2,3)
val squares = nums.map(x => x*x)

# 🟡 3. Understanding Spark Core & RDDs

✔️ Topics

What is an RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)

Creating RDDs: parallelize, textFile

Transformations vs Actions

Lazy evaluation, caching, and persistence
⭐ Example
Counting the number of words in a text file using RDDs.

# 🟡 4. DataFrames & Datasets

✔️ Learn

Difference between RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets

Creating DataFrames from CSV/JSON

Selecting, filtering, grouping, and aggregating data

Using Spark SQL for queries
⭐ Example
Filtering employees with salary > 50,000 using a DataFrame.

# 🟡 5. Data Collection & Basic Statistics

✔️ Topics

Collecting structured and unstructured data

Descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation

Basic charts and visualization using Spark + Scala libraries
⭐ Why Stats Matter
Understanding data distribution is crucial for analysis and performance tuning.

# 🟡 6. Root Cause Analysis & Debugging

✔️ Tools You Will Learn

Understanding Spark logs and errors

Debugging Spark jobs using Spark UI

Identifying performance bottlenecks (shuffles, joins, skewed data)
⭐ Example
Finding the cause of slow job execution and fixing partitioning issues.

# 🟡 7. Spark Transformations & Actions

✔️ Learn

Common transformations: map, filter, flatMap, reduceByKey, groupByKey

Common actions: collect, count, take, saveAsTextFile

Writing efficient Spark programs
⭐ Example
Aggregating sales data by product category.

# 🟡 8. Spark Streaming & Structured Streaming

✔️ Topics

Real-time data processing concepts

DStreams vs Structured Streaming

Windowed operations and aggregations

Checkpointing for fault tolerance
⭐ Simple Example
Counting the number of messages per minute in a Kafka stream.

# 🟡 9. Machine Learning with Spark MLlib

✔️ Concepts

Supervised vs Unsupervised learning

Spark MLlib algorithms: regression, classification, clustering

Pipelines, feature extraction, and model evaluation
⭐ Example
Building a logistic regression model to predict customer churn.

# 🟡 10. Exam Preparation Tutorial

✔️ What You Will Learn

Exam syllabus overview for Spark & Scala certification

Question types and difficulty distribution

Study plan: 1-week, 2-week, 30-day roadmap

Must-know commands, APIs, and performance tuning tips

Practice strategies to pass on the first attempt
